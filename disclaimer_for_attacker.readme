Welcome to this CTF!
Your main goal, is to crash the defender's VM before they patch it!
You will also get their VM file so you can analyze the code and write an exploit
for it that will cause it to CRASH!
NOTE:
Dosing or DDoSing your opponent isn't Tolerated, 
and will result in a disqualification!
Max Time: 30 minutes
the attackers get a 5 minute headstart,
to analyze the code!
The can, and should be changed by the referee!
Have fun, and stay legal!
